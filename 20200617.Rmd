## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
list_victimAges_female <- jsonlite::fromJSON("https://www.dropbox.com/s/3uijub7xheib405/list_victimAges_female.json?dl=1", 
    simplifyDataFrame = F)
str(list_victimAges_female)
View(list_victimAges_female$數目)
sum(list_victimAges_female$數目)
sum(list_victimAges_female$數目, na.rm = T)
list_victimAges_female$數目 <- as.integer(list_victimAges_female$數目)
list_victimAges_female$年齡層 <- as.factor(list_victimAges_female$年齡層)
levels_ages <- levels(list_victimAges_female$年齡層)
print(levels_ages)
levels_new <- c(levels_ages[c(12, 13, 1, 8, 2:7, 9:11)])
levels(list_victimAges_female$`年齡層`) <- levels_new
print(list_victimAges_female$`年齡層`)
```
